### A. COMPILER
> https://medium.com/@bdov_/what-happens-when-you-type-gcc-main-c-a4454564e96d#:~:text=The%20C%20programming%20language%20is,compiler%20for%20the%20C%20language.

**1, How do we compile and run a C program?**

-> Step 1: Creating a C Source File

-> Step 2: Compiling using GCC compiler

-> Step 3: Executing the program

**2, What is the compilation?**

The compilation is the process of converting the source code of the C language into machine code. 

C is a mid-level language, it needs a compiler to convert it into an executable code so that the program can be run on our machine.

**3, What goes inside the compilation process?**

**a, Preprocessor**

**b, Compiler** 

The compiler takes the preprocessed file and uses it to generate corresponding assembly code.

**c, Assembler**

Assembles the code into object code 
< Where assembly code represents a correspondence between program and machine code, object code represents pure machine code (ie. binary) >

### B. MACRO

> https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-preprocessor-macros

There are devided into 3 main groups: 
+ Including Header Files: #include
+ Macros using #define (Function like Macros...)
+ Conditional Compilation: #ifdef, #if, #defined, #else and #elif

a, How to include files with the #include directive
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include "myfile.h"

      int main() {
      	printf(message);
      	return 0;
      }
